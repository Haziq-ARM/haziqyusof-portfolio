					<h2>About Me</h2>

					<p>
					Hello! I'm Haziq Yusof, a seasoned Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, Python, and a passion for creating dynamic web and mobile applications. With 3 years of experience in the field, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects and leading cross-functional teams to success.

					My journey in the world of technology has been marked by continuous learning and a commitment to excellence. From developing cutting-edge web applications using ReactJS and Django to mastering cloud computing platforms like Azure and AWS, I thrive on the challenge of staying at the forefront of industry trends.
					</p>

					<p>

					What sets me apart is not just my technical prowess but also my ability to collaborate effectively, lead remote teams across different time zones, and translate complex ideas into user-friendly solutions. My work at Rhonda.ai allowed me to contribute to multi-million-dollar projects and maintain systems serving thousands of users daily.

					Outside of coding, I'm an advocate for efficient workflows, open-source contributions, and staying up-to-date with emerging technologies. I believe in the power of technology to transform industries and improve lives.

					</p>

					<p>
					I don't fit the stereotypical image of a nerd or geek; I also place a strong emphasis on maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Beyond working hours, I have a passion for staying active by participating in various sports such as volleyball and badminton.
